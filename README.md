# Pet-ology


__________Hanna Z, Lauren T, Katherine V, and Megan C.__________


*You lost your pet, they find your pet!*


___This project was created to help pet owners connect with others in their community to help find their lost pets. Another feature we added was to allow pet owners see dog-friendly parks, trails, and beaches near them. Using Google Maps API and a TinyDB database, we were able to create these features to the best of our ability in the time span we were given.___
